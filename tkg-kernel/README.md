# Some linux kernel patches and configs.

Configs and Patches I use to build kernel with TKG for my G14 2023 (ASUS GA402XY) using bore scheduler.

Mostly I take those from Mateusz linux-g14 repo:
https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/linux-g14/-/tree/6.17

linux-tkg.cfg should be placed in ${HOME}/.config/frogminer/linux-tkg.cfg
